# TerraLoad
This is a personal project I'm using as an excuse to learn more on remote sensing, do more math, brush up on python, etc. It's very much a work in progress, so it's quite messy and uncommented at the moment. Hopefully, as time goes on, that will change.

I'm using these satellite datasets for this project:

**Grace Dataset**

D. N. Wiese, D.-N. Yuan, C. Boening, F. W. Landerer, M. M. Watkins. 2023. JPL GRACE and GRACE-FO Mascon Ocean, Ice, and Hydrology Equivalent Water Height CRI Filtered RL06.3Mv04. Ver. RL06.3Mv04. PO.DAAC, CA, USA. Dataset accessed [2025-05-28] at https://doi.org/10.5067/TEMSC-3JC634

**Teopography dataset**

NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. 2022: ETOPO 2022 15 Arc-Second Global Relief Model. NOAA National Centers for Environmental Information. DOI: 10.25921/fd45-gt74. Accessed [6/1/2025]. at https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/etopo-global-relief-model

I'd have them directly in the repository...but I'm not quite sure if that'd be a problem or not. They are publically available though. I'm going to try and make sure every figure/animation can be seen on github.

**Orbital Elements script and animation**

The script and animation for the orbital elements seen in this notebook are modified versions of code and figures from this repository: https://github.com/jacopok/anomalies-visualization/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file

Go look at it, I learned a lot from it and so should you!

The still images for the geometry of the orbital elements are from the video "Kepler's Impossible Equation" by Welch Labs on Youtube. Go watch it, you'll learn a lot: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBkmyJ3TE0g

Just thought I'd start a list of sources that have been tremendous learning sources. Will be updated.
