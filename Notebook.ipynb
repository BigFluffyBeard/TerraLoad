    "Though this does use slightly different terminology, in this specific case, they are equivalent to what we're using with the TLE. As an example, the book uses Argument of Periapses in place of our Argument of Perigee, and Longitude of the Ascending Node (LAN) in place of our (RAAN). Periapsis is a more general term for the point in orbit where the orbiter is closest to the celestial object. Perigee is a term specifically refering to an object at the closest point in its orbit around Earth. So if someone used perigee when describing an orbit, you'd know that they're referring to an object orbiting Earth. In the  left figure this is showed as $\\omega$ between the ascending node and periapsis direction, and is measured along the satellite's direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between LAN and RAAN, however, is a bit more complicated. LAN refers to the angle between a reference direction, whcih is the origin longitude, and the ascending node. RAAN is similar, but it uses a specific reference direction, being the vernal equinox as the origin of longitude. They aren't quite the same thing, but if the LAN uses the vernal equinox as the origin of longitude, then it can be equivalent to the RAAN. In the left figure it is shown as the angle between the vernal equinox and the ascending node. Essentially this is the point where the satellite rises up through the equatorial plane. \n",
    "\n",
    "The vernal equinox direction...is a bit of a bridge of different disciplines describing the same thing in different ways. In the case of a TLE, which would be a geometric definition, is the vector from the center of the Earth to the center of the Sun on the first light of Spring. In the image, it is depicted as the angle $\\Omega$ between the vernal equinox vector and the ascending node.\n",
    "\n",
    "From here we can also see the eccentricity $e$, which is interestingly represented as the vector $\\bar{e}$ from the center of the Earth to periapsis. Eccentricity, in the context of orbits, is the measure of how stretched the orbit is. If you have $ e = 0$, then you'll have a perfectly circular orbit (the orbit of your fantasies). The closer the parameter gets to $e = 1$, he more stretched  the orbit becomes, with an $e = 1$ resulting in a parabolic trajectory. The parabolic trajectory means the satellite the exact energy needed to escape the (in this case) Earth's gravitational influence, but has zero remaining mechanical energy. This means that after escape, it remains on that trajectory to infinity while continuously slowing down, but it never reaches zero. If the parameter is $e > 1$ the satellite is on a hyperbolic escape trajectory with energy to spare, keeping it at a minimum velocity. When represented as a vector, essentricity is dependent on: \n",

    "| Position vector | $\\vec{r}$ |\n",
    "| Gravitational parameter of central mass | $\\mu = G * M$ |\n",
    "\n",
    "So what does $\\vec{v} \\times \\vec{h}$ result in? Well, it will result in a vector that's perpendicular to the angular momentum vector $\\vec{h}$. This next one is a bit tricky and it requires us to think about units. $\\frac{1}{\\mu}$ is a conversion factor to handle units and the magnitude of the vector. If you have a velocity vector $\\vec{v}$, it's probably going to have some units like $\\frac{km}{sec}$ tied to it. Your specific angular momentum vector $\\vec{h}$ will probably also have units tied to it, which could be $\\frac{km^2}{sec}$. When you cross these two vectors, you still multiply the units, which would result in $\\frac{km^3}{sec^2}$. Eccentricity $e$ is, itself, a scalar that represents both the shape of the orbit and the magnitude of its vector counterpart $\\vec{e}$. Both of these are dimensionless in nature because they describe direction and shape. To make $\\vec{e}$ unitless, you need to scale it by dividing by the gravitational parameter of your central mass (which should be in the same units). In this gase, it should be $\\frac{km^3}{sec^2}$, resulting in a dimensionless parameter. After this, you subtract the unit vector $\\frac{\\vec{r}}{\\|\\vec{r}\\|}$, which is the unit position vector pointing towards periapsis (as the $\\vec{e}$ does in the figure above) to keep it pointing towards the periapsis of your orbit. Then bamn, you have your eccentricity vector that points towards periapsis! The TLE does this work for you though by giving you the scalar $e$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alright, with all that...what do we do from here to arrive at our obit for our satellite? Well, the first thing we can do is solve for our semi-major axis. The semi-major axis of an orbit depends a bit on the type of orbit you're working with. If you're looking at a circular orbit, it will just be the orbital radius. However, if your orbit is elliptical, the semi-major axis will be half the length of the major axis (which is the longest diameter). There are quite a few methods you can use to calculate it depending on what you know about your orbit. Since we know both the gravitational parameter $/mu$ and the mean motion $n$, we can calculate the length of the semi-major axis by:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "        a = (\\frac{\\mu}{\\frac{2 \\pi n}{86400}})^{1/3}\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "You want the mean motion converted into radians per second, due to Kepler's third law assuming angular motion in radians and gravity parameter $u$ using seconds. Mean motion $n$ goes by revolutions per day, so you want to convert from revolutions to radians, and days to seconds. This calculation will result in a semi-major axis in kilometers. From here, it gets a bit tricky. Now that we have a bit of information about the shape of this orbit...well, wouldn't you like to know about the position of the satellite in the orbit? That is, after all, the purpose of a TLE, right? Well, good news! We can get that in only three...not-so-simple steps! We'll want to know about the True, Mean, and Eccentric Anomalies of the orbit. I'm gonna split these up a bit, because I want to try and do them justice.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Mean Anomaly**\n",
    "    The Mean Anomaly is a measure of time. Specifically, the time that has passed since our satellite passed its periapsis. It can also tell us were our satellite would be at a specific time after passing periapsis, given a constant angular speed of course. Dpending on how you approach finding an orbit, you may have to solve for this, which there are several methods to do so. For example, if you know the mean motion $n$, time since the satellite passed periapsis (can call this $s$), and the current time $t$, you could solve for Mean Anomaly by:\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "        M = n(t - s)\n",
    "    $$\n",
    "    But by a happy coincidence, we have already been given the Mean Anomaly by the TLE. It is important to note that this only gives a position in time along the orbit, not the position in space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Eccentric Anomaly**\n",
    "    This is the tricky one. The Eccentric Anomaly is an angular parameter that describes the position of an object moving along a Keplerian orbit. But here's a question for you: What is the the reference frame of the eccentricity anomaly? It's not the focus, instead it's the center of the ellipse. So how do we get the eccentric anomaly E? Well, we first gotta understand Kepler's equation.\n",
